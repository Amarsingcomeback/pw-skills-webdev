      Web design refers to the process of creating the visual appearance and
      layout of a website. This involves choosing colors, fonts, and images, as
      well as determining the overall structure of the website and how it will
      be navigated. The goal of web design is to create an attractive,
      user-friendly website that effectively communicates the organization's
      message or product to its target audience. A good web design should be
      visually appealing, easy to navigate, and provide a seamless user
      experience. Web designers use various tools and technologies such as
      graphic design software, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create visually
      appealing and functional websites.
