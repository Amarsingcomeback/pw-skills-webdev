                  CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content.
                  CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer
                  questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content
                  display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I
                  decorate my webpage with background images and colors? What is CSS?
                  Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
                  language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use
                  to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
                  paragraph text, setting the color to red
                </p>

              <h1>JAVASCRIPT</h1>
              <p>
                  JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time
                  compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it
                  is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many
                  non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache
                  CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based,
                  multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting
                  object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional
                  programming) styles.
